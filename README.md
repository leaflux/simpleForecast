# simpleForecast
A single page weather app, made to practice JavaScript fundamentals.

# Setup Guide
For the current weather and 3-hour forecast data, I used OpenWeatherMap's API.
Sign up for an account on openweathermap.org to get your personal API key, and set it to the variable 'API_Key' in config.js to use this app.

# More Info
simpleForecast is a one page weather app I designed to test the basic JavaScript concepts I've learned online.
My overall goals were to make something functional and to stick closely with vanilla JavaScript.
If you're a beginner like me, I hope you can learn something by reading my code.

simpleForecast is written in JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML. Handlebars.js is also used for templating.
